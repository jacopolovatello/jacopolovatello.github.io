                    <p>Model 82 is the last project I worked on while at Softube. Due to the tight schedule, I didn't work on the
                        sequencer and arpeggiator emulations, if not for some small details, I instead was tasked with the modeling
                        of the hardware unit, and the design of the drive and doubling effects. I also developed the logic needed
                        for the sequencer and arpeggiator to interact with the main synth voice.

                    <p>Model 84 is Softube's first fully modeled polyphonic synthesizer. This required the 
                       development of new circuit modeling techniques that combined both accuracy and 
                       a limited CPU consumption. Special care has been taken in developing the 
                       original voice allocation modes, replicating the chorus noise and in emulating 
                       the phasing artifacts characterizing the Unison mode.

                <header><h2>BIO</h2></header>
                <p>Born 1992 in Bergamo, Italy. I live and work in Linköping, Sweden.<p>
                <p>After graduating from Politecnico di Milano (MSc) and Università degli Studi di Milano (BSc), I moved to Sweden and started working for <a href="https://softube.com/">Softube</a> as DSP Developer.
                   There, I designed algorithms for sound synthesis and processing, with a focus on the modeling of analog and mixed-signal electronic circuits.
                   I took the role of tech lead for different products and worked on projects in partnership with <a href="https://weiss.ch/">Weiss Engineering Ltd.</a>, <a href="https://chandlerlimited.com/">Chandler Limited</a>, <a href="https://buchla.com/">Buchla</a> and <a href="https://uaudio.com/">Universal Audio</a>.<p>
                <p>In early 2022, I left Softube and, for a brief period of time, I joined <a href=" https://eliassoftware.com/">Elias Software</a>. There I designed and implemented audio DSP effects for their real-time sound synthesis and adaptive music engine Elias 4.
                <p>In late 2022, I left Elias Software and started working for <a href="https://neuraldsp.com/">Neural DSP</a>. There I develop DSP algorithms for audio plugins and I help build and design tools for DSP research and development.
                <p>Throughout 2022 and 2023, I worked during my spare time to launch <a href="https://eftilo.com/">Eftilo</a>, my own audio plugin company. At Eftilo I handle everything, from the website, framework and products design, development and maintenance, to the marketing, customer support and administration.</p>
                <p>When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time in Swedish forests, lakes, and mountains. I'm often out in the nature running, training or hiking.
                   I also enjoy playing guitar.
                <p>
